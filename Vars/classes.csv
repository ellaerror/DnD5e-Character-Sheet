Artificer,8,Magical Tinkering:At 1st level$ you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability$ you must have tinker's tools or other artisan's tools  in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice~<ul><li>The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</il><li>Whenever tapped by a creature$ the object emits a re­corded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object$ and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.</il><li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind$ waves$ chirping$ or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away. </il><li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object's sur­faces. This effect can be a picture$ up to  25 words of text$ lines and shapes$ or a mixture of these elements$ as you like.</il></ul>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action$ you can touch the object and end the property early.<br>You can bestow magic on multiple objects$ touching one object each time you use this feature$ though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your max­imum$ the oldest property immediately ends$ and then the new property applies.;Spellcasting:You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result$ you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers$ you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way$ you look as if you're producing wonders using mundane items or out­landish inventions.<br><b>Tools Required</b><br>You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-- specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-- in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5$  'Equipment$' in  the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.<br>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at  2nd level$ you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.<br><b>Cantrips</b><br>At 1st level$ you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels$ you learn addi­tional  artificer cantrips of your choice$ as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.<br>When you gain a level in this class$ you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another can­trip from the artificer spell list.<br><b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b><br>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher$ you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are avail­able for you to cast$ choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so$ choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level$ rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br>For example$ if you are a 5th-level artificer$ you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an In­telligence of 14$ your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level$ in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds$ you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting fo­cuses~ at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.<br><b>Spellcasting Ability</b><br>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells$ your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition$ you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an at­tack roll with one.<br><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br><b>Spell attack modifier</b> your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br><b>Ritual Casting</b><br>You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.,Infuse Item:At 2nd level$ you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.<br><b>Infusions Known</b><br>When you gain this feature$ pick four artificer infusions to learn$ choosing from the 'Artificer Infusions' section at the end of the class's description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class$ as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.<br>Whenever you gain a level in this class$ you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.<br><b>Infusing an Item</b><br>Whenever you finish a long rest$ you can touch a non­magical object and imbue it with one of your artificer in­fusions$ turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects$ as specified in the infu­sion's description. If the item requires attunement$ you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later$ you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see 'Attunement' in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).<br>Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely$ but when you die$ the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.<br>You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest$ the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer ta­ble. You must touch each of the objects$ and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover$ no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of in­fusions$  the  oldest infusion immediately ends$ and then the new infusion applies. ,Artificer Specialist:At 3rd level$ you choose the type of specialist you are. Your choice grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 15th level.;The Right Tool for the Job:At 3rd level$ you learn how to produce exactly the tool you need~ with tinker's tools in hand$ you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you.

Though the product of magic$ the tools are nonmagical$ and they vanish when you use this fea­ture again.,Ability Score Improvement:You can increase one ability score of your choice by 2$ or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.,Ability Score Improvement:You can increase one ability score of your choice by 2$ or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal$ you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<>Using the optional feats rule$ you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.,,Magic Item Adept:When you reach 10th level$ you achieve a profound un­derstanding of how to use and make magic items~<ul><li>You can attune to up to four magic items at once.</li><li>If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon$ it takes you a quarter of the normal time$ and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.</li></ul>,Spell-Storing Item:At 11th level$ you learn how to store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest$ you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus$ and you store a spell in it$ choosing a  1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1  action to cast (you needn't have it prepared).<br>While holding the object$ a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it$ using your spellcast­ing ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration$ the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the ob­ject until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.,Ability Score Improvement:You can increase one ability score of your choice by 2$ or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal$ you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<>Using the optional feats rule$ you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.,,Magic Item Savant:At 14th level$ your skill with magic items deepens more~<ul><li>You can attune to up to five magic items at once.</li><li>You ignore all class$ race$ spell$ and level require­ments on attuning to or using a magic item.</li></ul>,,Ability Score Improvement:You can increase one ability score of your choice by 2$ or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours$ use the creature's bonus instead of yours.

When you revert to your normal form$ you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However$ if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points$ any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example$ if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left$ you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points$ you aren't knocked unconscious.</li><li>You can't cast spells$ and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast$ however$ or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell$ such as call lightning$ that you've already cast.</li><li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class$ race$ or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However$ you can't use any of your special senses$ such as darkvision$ unless your new form also has that sense.</li><li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space$ merges into your new form$ or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal$ but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment$ based on the creature's shape and size.
